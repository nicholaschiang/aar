### Advanced Authentic Research

The Advanced Authentic Research (AAR) Program is a unique opportunity for
students in grades 10-12 where it is designed for students with interest,
passion, curiosity, and perseverance to investigate an authentic topic of their
choosing. Students are paired with mentors in the particular field of research
who will support and facilitate each students' work in their own laboratories,
offices, and other settings. The student research will be supported by the
process-oriented curriculum developed by the AAR Team. The recursive nature of
the research process allows students to go back and forth between the different
stages of inquiry as they encounter new information. The expectation is that
students will spend about 60 hours per semester (about 4 hours per week) on
their project. The AAR program earns 5 career and technical education credits
per semester.

## My Project

To what extent can we use machine learning techniques to automatically generate
music (namely hip-hop songs)?

### Generating Hip-Hop with Machine Learning
Create a program that can generate an original, 3min song (beat, lyricism,
vocals) given a word or phrase
- Generate unique and original beats on command
  - Weâ€™d probably provide a repository of samples (e.g. hi-hats, snares, 808s)
  - Program would follow basic rhythmic structure and layout samples in an
    artistic way
- Generate comprehensible lyrics
  - Lots of existing research: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00379.pdf
- Combine lyrics (via text-to-speech) and beat
  - Text-to-speech program dictates generated lyrics to the given beat (
    following the same rhythmic structure used to generate the beat)
- Do all of that in under a minute and create a website to make the program
  publicly available

### Existing Research

Included in this repository are select papers and patents (in PDF form) to
provide an idea of the existing research within the field of machine creativity
as it relates to music generation.
- DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation
  - Malmi et al. contribute a prediction model to identify the next line of
    existing lyrics from a set of candidate next lines.
  - They use this model to combine lines from existing songs, producing lyrics
    with rhyme and meaning.
- Automatic Music Generating Method and Device
- Automatically Updated Apparatus for Generating Music
